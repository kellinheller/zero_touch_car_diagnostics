## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

+#### Gemini API Key (Required for AI Diagnostics)
+1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
+2. Sign in with your Google account
+3. Create a new API key
+4. Open the app → Settings → Enter your API key
+5. Select model: **Gemini 2.5 Pro (Free Tier, Recommended)**

+**Free Tier Limits:**
+- 1,500 requests per day
+- Gemini 2.5 Pro free tier recommended

#### Google Maps API Key (Required for Map Display)
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable Maps SDK for Android
3. Create an API key
4. Add key to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
       android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE"/>
   ```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
# Development mode (simulation)
flutter run

# With Gemini API key via command line (optional)
flutter run \
  --dart-define=GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY \
  --dart-define=GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
```

### 4. Connect to Vehicle
1. Pair your ELM327 adapter via Bluetooth settings (or connect USB)
2. Open the app
3. Select transport: Bluetooth, USB, or Simulation
4. Tap "Connect"
5. Start trip recording for route analysis
6. Tap "Diagnose" for AI-powered diagnostics

## Architecture

### OBD-II Layer
- `ObdConnection` (abstract): Transport interface
- `BluetoothObdConnection`: Bluetooth Classic RFCOMM
- `UsbObdConnection`: USB Serial communication
- `SimulationObdConnection`: Mock data for development
- `Elm327Protocol`: ELM327 initialization and PID queries
- `ObdPidRegistry`: All 50+ generic OBD-II PIDs with parsers

### Services
- `DiagnosticsService`: High-level OBD sampling
- `GeminiClient`: AI diagnostics via Google Gemini
- `TripLoggingService`: Trip recording with sensor fusion
- `RouteAnalyzerService`: Historical route analysis and recommendations
- `SettingsService`: Persistent configuration storage

### Sensors
- GPS: Real-time location tracking via `geolocator`
- Accelerometer: Harsh braking/acceleration detection
- Gyroscope: Sharp turn detection
- OBD-II: Engine parameters (RPM, load, temperature, etc.)

## Supported OBD-II PIDs

The app supports all generic Mode 01 PIDs including:
- **Engine**: RPM, load, timing advance, oil temperature
- **Fuel**: Pressure, trim (bank 1/2), level, consumption rate
- **Temperature**: Coolant, intake air, ambient
- **Airflow**: MAF, intake manifold pressure
- **Throttle**: Position, commanded actuator
- **System**: OBD standards, fuel type, distance traveled
- **Diagnostics**: Monitor status, freeze frame, DTCs

See [`lib/services/obd_pid_registry.dart`](lib/services/obd_pid_registry.dart) for complete list.

## Trip Logging & Route Analysis

### Damage Scoring Algorithm
The app calculates a real-time damage score based on:
- **Accelerometer**: Harsh acceleration/braking (>15 m/s²)
- **Gyroscope**: Sharp turns and sudden maneuvers
- **OBD Data**:
  - High RPM (>4000 rpm)
  - Engine load (>80%)
  - Overheating (>100°C coolant)

### Route Recommendations
Based on historical trip data:
1. Groups trips by similar start/end points
2. Calculates average damage score per route
3. Factors in time and distance
4. Recommends best route with lowest wear

## Notes on Accuracy

AI diagnostics accuracy depends on:
- Completeness of OBD data available from vehicle
- Quality of sensor readings
- Gemini model's training data
- Prompt engineering and structured output format

The app uses strict JSON schema responses from Gemini to ensure consistent, parseable diagnostics.

## Next Steps

- [ ] iOS CoreBluetooth implementation (BLE adapters)
- [ ] Offline LLM integration for privacy
- [ ] Cloud sync for trip history
- [ ] Vehicle-specific PID customization
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Predictive maintenance alerts
- [ ] Integration with repair shop APIs

## Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth Connection Timeouts
- Ensure ELM327 adapter is powered (usually from OBD-II port)
- Check adapter is in pairing mode
- Android 12+: Grant Bluetooth permissions in app
- Keep-alive mechanism prevents timeouts after 10 seconds of inactivity

### GPS Not Working
- Enable location services in Android settings
- Grant location permission to app
- Ensure device has GPS hardware
- Test outdoors for better signal

### Gemini API Errors
- Verify API key in Settings
- Check internet connection
- Free tier: 1,500 requests/day limit
- Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for best performance

### No Sensor Data During Trips
- Ensure trip recording is started before driving
- Check sensor permissions granted
- Verify OBD connection is active
- Phone must remain in foreground or use background location permission
